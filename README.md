# Research on Technological Advances and GDP Growth

This repository contains all the necessary data and scripts used in the research paper exploring the relationship between technological advances and GDP growth across developed and developing countries. The research investigates if technological growth correlates with economic growth as represented by GDP, using statistical analysis of historical data.

## Data Description

The repository includes data from two primary sources:

1. **Penn World Table (PWT):** Provides comprehensive data on relative levels of income, output, inputs, and productivity for 183 countries spanning from 1950 to 2019.
   - **Data Source:** [Penn World Table](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/)
   - **File:** `pwt_1001.csv` - This file contains the real GDP, income levels, and productivity measures extracted from the Penn World Table.

2. **NBER Technological Data:** Features an unbalanced panel dataset with information on the adoption of over 100 technologies in more than 150 countries since 1800.
   - **Data Source:** [NBER Technology Data](https://data.nber.org/data-appendix/w15319/)
   - **File:** `chat.dta` - This file includes data on technological adoption rates for specified technologies across various countries.

## Results

The results of the analysis are stored in the following files:
- GDP growth analysis.docx : analysis on this research.

## Conclusion

The findings suggest a positive correlation between technological advancement and GDP growth, particularly in developed countries. The scripts provided facilitate replication of the analysis and further exploration of the data.

## Further Research

Further investigations could explore the causality between technological growth and GDP and the impact of R&D investments on economic growth. Researchers are encouraged to extend the datasets and analytical methods used in this study.
